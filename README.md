## Introduction

`adsb-ultrafeeder™` is an ADS-B data collector container that can be used to:

- retrieve ADS-B data from your SDR or other device
- display it on a local map, including options to show tracks, heatmaps, and system performance graphs
- forward the data to one or more aggregators using BEAST/BEAST-REDUCE/BEAST-REDUCE-PLUS format
- send MLAT data to these aggregators
- receive and consolidate MLAT results data (built-in `mlathub`)
- Interface with external visualization tools such as Grafana using statistics data available in InfluxDB and Prometheus format

In order to accomplish this, the container makes use of the following underlying technologies:

- SDR-Enthusiasts™ [Docker Base-Image](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-baseimage)
- [Wiedehopf's branch of `readsb`](https://github.com/wiedehopf/readsb)
- Wiedehopf's [tar1090](https://github.com/wiedehopf/tar1090) graphical interface
- Wiedehopf's [graphs1090](https://github.com/wiedehopf/graphs1090)
- [MLAT Client](https://github.com/adsbxchange/mlat-client.git)

It builds and runs on `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm/v7 (linux/armhf)` and `linux/arm64` architectures.
![ultrafeeder container architecture](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-adsb-ultrafeeder/assets/15090643/12b7f054-a77a-4c21-8f72-d0069cc9af84)

## Up-and-Running Quickly with `docker-compose`

- An example [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) file can be found in this repository.
- The accompanying environment variable values are defined in the [`.env`](.env) file in this repository

Once you have [installed Docker](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-install), you can follow these lines of code to get up and running in very little time:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p -m 777 /opt/adsb
cd /opt/adsb
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-adsb-ultrafeeder/main/docker-compose.yml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-adsb-ultrafeeder/main/.env
```

Then edit the `docker-compose.yml` and `.env` files and make any changes as needed. Please configure ALL variables in `.env`:

```bash
nano docker-compose.yml
nano .env
```

Finally, bring up the stack. This may take a minute as it will automatically download the container and start it up:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Ports

Some common ports are as follows (which may or may not be in use depending on your configuration). You can override the port mappings with the parameters shown in the [Optional Networking Parameters section](#optional-networking-parameters).

The general principle behind the port numbering, is:

- `30xxx` ports are connected to the main instance `readsb` that decodes and processes the SDR data
- `31xxx` ports are connected to the MLAT Hub
- `92xx` ports are for Prometheus statistics output
- `80` contains the Tar1090 web interface

| Port                        | Details                                            |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `30001/tcp`                 | Raw protocol input                                 |
| `30002/tcp`                 | Raw protocol output                                |
| `30003/tcp`                 | SBS/Basestation protocol output                    |
| `32006/tcp`                 | SBS/Basestation protocol input                     |
| `30004/tcp`<br/>`30104/tcp` | Beast protocol input                               |
| `30005/tcp`                 | Beast protocol output                              |
| `30006/tcp`                 | Beast reduce protocol output                       |
| `30047/tcp`                 | Json position output                               |
| `31003/tcp`                 | MLATHUB SBS/Basestation protocol output            |
| `31004/tcp`                 | MLATHUB Beast protocol input                       |
| `31005/tcp`                 | MLATHUB Beast protocol output                      |
| `31006/tcp`                 | MLATHUB Beast-reduce protocol output               |
| `9273/tcp`                  | Prometheus http endpoint with data from `telegraf` |
| `9274/tcp`                  | Prometheus http endpoint with data from `readsb`   |
| `80/tcp`                    | Tar1090 (map) web interface                        |

Any of these ports can be made available to the host system by using the `ports:` directive in your `docker-compose.yml`. The container's web interface is rendered to port `80` in the container. This can be mapped to a port on the host using the docker-compose `ports` directive. In the example [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) file, the container's Tar1090 interface is mapped to `8080` on the host system, and ports `9273-9274` are exposed as-is:

```yaml
    ports:
      - 8080:80               # to expose the web interface
      - 9273-9274:9273-9274   # to expose the statistics interface to Prometheus
```

Json position output:

- outputs an aircraft object for every new position received for an aircraft. The following parameters (which can be added with `READSB_EXTRA_ARGS`) control this output:
- `--net-json-port-interval` Set minimum interval between outputs per aircraft for TCP json output, default: 0.0 (every position)
- `--net-json-port-include-noposition` TCP json position output: include aircraft without position (state is sent for aircraft for every DF11 with CRC if the aircraft hasn't sent a position in the last 10 seconds and interval allowing)
- each json object will be on a new line
- <https://github.com/wiedehopf/readsb/blob/dev/README-json.md>

Aircraft.json:

- <https://github.com/wiedehopf/readsb/blob/dev/README-json.md>
- available on the same port as the web interface, example: `http://192.168.x.yy:8087/data/aircraft.json`

## Runtime Environment Variables

The sections below describe how to configure each part of the container functionality. Each section describes what's needed to come up with a minimally viable configuration, followed by additional / optional parameters that can also be set.

Note:

- to enable a parameter, you can set it to any of `1`, `true`, `on`, `enabled`, `enable`, `yes`, or `y`. In the table below, we'll simply use `true` for convenience.
- to disable a parameter, you can set it to anything else or simply leave it undefined.

### General Configuration

You need to make sure that the USB device can be accessed by the container. The best way to do so, is by adding the following to your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
    device_cgroup_rules:
      - 'c 189:* rwm'
...
    volumes:
      - /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb:rw
```

The advantage of doing this (over simply adding a `device:` directive pointing at the USB port) is that the construction above will automatically recover if you "hot plug" your dongle. ⚠️This feature requires a recent version of docker-compose (version >=2.3). Make sure your system is up to date if dongles are not found. ⚠️

### Getting ADSB data to the Ultrafeeder

There are two ways to provide ADSB data to the Ultrafeeder:

- provide the container with access to an SDR or other hardware device that collects ADSB data
- allow the container to connect to a ADSB data source in Beast, Raw, or SBS format

These methods are not mutually exclusive - you can use both at the same time if you want.

#### Connecting to an SDR or other hardware device

If you want to connect your SDR to the container, here's how to do that:

##### Mandatory parameters

| Variable               | Description                                                                                                                           | Controls which `readsb` option | Default        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------- |
| `READSB_DEVICE_TYPE`   | If using an SDR, set this to `rtlsdr`, `modesbeast`, `gnshulc` depending on the model of your SDR. If not using an SDR, leave un-set. | `--device-type=<type>`         | Unset          |
| `READSB_RTLSDR_DEVICE` | Select device by serial number.                                                                                                       | `--device=<serial>`            | Unset          |
| `READSB_BEAST_SERIAL`  | only when type `modesbeast` or `gnshulc` is used: Path to Beast serial device.                                                        | `--beast-serial=<path>`        | `/dev/ttyUSB0` |

##### Optional/Additional Parameters

| Variable            | Description                                                                                                                                 | Controls which `readsb` option | Default  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------- |
| `READSB_GAIN`       | Set gain (in dB). Use `autogain` to have the container determine an appropriate gain, more on this below. Leave this parameter empty (recommended) to use [`readsb`'s built-in auto-gain](#using-readsbs-built-in-autogain-recommended), or set it to `omit` or `off` to not pass this parameter to `readsb`              | `--gain=<db>`                  | Max gain |
| `READSB_RTLSDR_PPM` | Set oscillator frequency correction in PPM. See [Estimating PPM](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-readsb-protobuf/#estimating-ppm) | `--ppm=<correction>`           | Unset    |

As of November 2024, we are recommending to leave the `READSB_GAIN` parameter empty by not including it in your configuration. This will engage the new built-in [autogain of `readsb`](https://github.com/wiedehopf/readsb?tab=readme-ov-file#autogain). This new algorithm uses continuous noise and signal strength measurements and is highly effective in environments with a mix of strong, local signals and distant, weak signals.

(Experts only:) If you want to pass in any autogain parameters to `readsb`, you can do so by setting `READSB_GAIN` to (for example) `READSB_GAIN=auto-verbose,0,25,31,243`. See the explanation at Wiedehopf's [`readsb` repository](https://github.com/wiedehopf/readsb?tab=readme-ov-file#autogain) for more information about these parameters

###### Using the original AutoGain algorithm

You can still use the original autogain algorithm by setting `READSB_GAIN=autogain`. That algorithm is built into the container and it will take signal strength measurements to determine the optimal gain. The AutoGain functionality is based on a (slightly) modified version of [Wiedehopf's AutoGain](https://github.com/wiedehopf/autogain). AutoGain will only work with `rtlsdr` style receivers.

Note that AutoGain is not related to the SDR's AGC setting (controlled with the `READSB_RTLSDR_ENABLE_AGC` variable). We do not recommend enabling AGC for Ultrafeeder or any other ADS-B decoder.

There are 2 distinct periods in which the container will attempt to figure out the gain:

- The initial period of 2 hours, in which an adjustment is done every 5 minutes
- The subsequent period, in which an adjustment is done once every day

Please note that in order for the initial period to complete, the container must run for 90 minutes without restarting.

When taking measurements, if the percentage of "strong signals" (i.e., ADSB messages with RSSI > 3 dB) is larger than 6%, AutoGain will reduce the receiver's gain by 1 setting. Similarly, if the percentage of strong signals is smaller than 2.5%, AutoGain will increment the receiver's gain by 1 setting. When AutoGain changes the gain value, the `readsb` component of the container will restart. This may show as a disconnect / reconnected in container logs.

We recommend running the initial period during times when there are a lot of planes overhead, so the system will get a good initial view of what signals look like when traffic is at its peak for your location. If you forgot to do this for any reason, feel free to give the AutoGain reset command (see below) during flights busy hour.

Although not recommended, you can change the measurement intervals and low/high cutoffs with these parameters:

| Environment Variable                  | Purpose                                                                                                       | Default |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `READSB_AUTOGAIN_INITIAL_TIMEPERIOD`  | How long the Initial Time Period should last (in seconds)                                                     | `7200`  |
| `READSB_AUTOGAIN_INITIAL_INTERVAL`    | The measurement interval to optimize gain during the initial period of 90 minutes (in seconds)                | `300`   |
| `READSB_AUTOGAIN_SUBSEQUENT_INTERVAL` | The measurement interval to optimize gain during the subsequent period (in seconds)                           | `86400` |
| `READSB_AUTOGAIN_LOW_PCT`             | If the percentage of "strong signals" (stronger than 3dBFS RSSI) is below this number, gain will be increased | `2.5`   |
| `READSB_AUTOGAIN_HIGH_PCT`            | If the percentage of "strong signals" (stronger than 3dBFS RSSI) is above this number, gain will be decreased | `6.0`   |

If you need to reset AutoGain and start over determining the gain, you can do so with this command:

```bash
docker exec -it ultrafeeder /usr/local/bin/autogain1090 reset
```

#### Connecting to external ADSB data sources

In addition to (or instead of) connecting to an SDR or hardware device to get ADSB data, the container also supports ingesting or sending data from a TCP port. Here are some parameters that you need to configure if you want to make this happen:

##### All-in-One Configuration using `ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG`

`ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG` is a new parameter that can be used instead of separately defining `READSB_NET_CONNECTOR`, `MLAT_NET_CONNECTOR`, `MLATHUB_NET_CONNECTOR`/`MLATHUB_CONFIG`. These legacy parameters will still work; however, we wanted to provide a single parameter that enables configuration of incoming and outgoing ADSB data, MLAT-client data, and MLATHUB data.

Note that `ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG` and `ULTRAFEEDER_NET_CONNECTOR` can be used interchangeably; in this documentation, we'll use `ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG` as an example.

`ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG` syntax:

The ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG parameter can have multiple config strings, separated by a `;`. Please note that the config strings cannot contain `;` or `,` - undefined things may happen if these characters are present.

The parameters and their potential values are explained below the construct definitions.
The following constructs are available: `adsb`, `mlat`, and `mlathub`.

###### `adsb` constuct: connecting to an ADSB data source or sending ADSB data to another host or port

```yaml
- ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG=adsb,<host>,<port>,<protocol>[,uuid=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX][,silent_fail][,<extra-arguments>]
```

For example, to send data to `adsb.lol` at host `in.adsb.lol`, port `30004`, using the `beast_reduce_out` protocol, and the UUID defined by `${UUID_ADSBLOL}`, you would use:

```yaml
- ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG=adsb,in.adsb.lol,30004,beast_reduce_plus_out,uuid=${UUID_ADSBLOL}
```

###### `mlat` construct: sending MLAT data to a MLAT Server

Sending MLAT data to a remote MLAT Server. Note that any MLAT return data from the MLAT Server will automatically be integrated with Ultrafeeder for display on your TAR1090 map, etc.

This is the construction you'd use in 90% of all use cases:

```yaml
- ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG=mlat,<host>,<port>[,<return_port>][,uuid=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX][,<extra-arguments>]
```

The `<return_port>` parameter is included for legacy/backwards compatibility purposes, but there's almost no modern use case for which you would need to include it.

For example, to send MLAT data to `adsb.lol` at port `31090`, using the UUID defined by `${UUID_ADSBLOL}`, you would use:

```yaml
- ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG=mlat,in.adsb.lol,31090,uuid=${UUID_ADSBLOL}
```

If you want to use data from a source that is different from the built-in `readsb` instance and the send this data to a remote MLAT Server, you can specify this as follows:

```yaml
- ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG=mlat,<host>,<port>[,<return_port>][,uuid=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX][,input_connect=<remote-host>:<port>][,input_type=<input_type>][,lat=xx.xxxx][,lon=yy.yyyy][,alt=zzz][,<extra-arguments>]
```

Here, `<host>` and `<port>` are mandatory, <return_port> is optional (and can be omitted in almost every use case). The remainder of the parameters are passed directly to the `MLAT Client` instance. `docker exec -it planefence mlatclient --help` will show you which commandline options are available.

###### Integrate external MLAT return data with Ultrafeeder

Even though MLAT return data received from any MLAT Servers connected directly to Ultrafeeder are automatically integrated with Ultrafeeder, this is not the case if you are using external containers or software to send MLAT data to a MLAT Server. The latter would be the case if you use the FlightAware/PiAware container, the FR24 container, RadarVirtuel container, etc.

In this case, you can use the `mlathub` construct to collect MLAT return data from these external MLAT clients, and integrate them with Ultrafeeder data. You can further configure this MLAT Hub as described in the section [Configuring the built-in MLAT Hub](#configuring-the-built-in-mlat-hub).

```yaml
- ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG=mlathub,<host>,<port>,<protocol>[,uuid=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX][,silent_fail][,<extra-arguments>]
```

For example:

```yaml
- ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG=mlathub,radarvirtuel,30105,beast_in
```

###### `ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG` parameters

| parameter | Description | Mandatory/Optional |
|------|-------|-------|
| `<host>` | an IP address/hostname/containername for incoming or outgoing connections | Mandatory |
| `<port>` / `<return_port>` | TCP port numbers | Mandatory |
| `protocol` | One of the following | Mandatory |
| - `beast_reduce_out` | Beast-format output with lower data throughput (saves bandwidth and CPU) | |
| - `beast_reduce_plus_out` | Beast-format output with extra data (UUID). This is the preferred format when feeding the "new" aggregator services | |
| - `beast_out` | Beast-format output | |
| - `beast_in` | Beast-format input | |
| - `raw_out` | Raw output | |
| - `raw_in` | Raw input | |

| - `vrs_out` | SBS-format output | |
| - `uat_in` | "special" RAW format input as generated by the `dump978` container on port 30978. It is advisable to use this protocol and port to get UAT data from dump978, for example: `- ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG=adsb,dump978,30978,uat_in` | |
| - `uuid` | Universally Unique Identifier. You can reuse the one you generated for AdsbExchange, or you can generate a new one with this Linux command: `cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid`. If omitted, it will use the `UUID` environment parameter, or if that one doesn't exist, it will leave the field empty | |
| - `name` | a friendly name (containing any character of the set \[A-Za-z0-9_-\] - do not use any spaces, quotes, or other non-alphanumeric characters!) that will be sent to the MLAT Server, used to identify the station by name. If omitted, it will use the `MLAT_USER` parameter, or if that one doesn't exist, it will leave the field empty | |
| - `input_connect` | a `host:port` combination where the ADSB data for this MLAT connection is coming from. If omitted, it will get its input from the `readsb` instance that is present in the container | |
| - `input_type` | the type of data that the input source provides. This can be one of these: `auto`, `dump1090`, `beast`, `radarcape_12mhz`, `radarcape_gps`, `radarcape`, `sbs`, or `avrmlat`. If omitted, the value of the `MLAT_INPUT_TYPE` variable will be used, or if that one does not exist, `auto` will be used | |
| - `silent_fail` | if present as one of the parameters of the `adsb` or `mlathub` construct, it will mute any failure notifications for this connection. (`silent_fail` is not supported for the `mlat` construct.) | Mandatory |

##### Networking parameters

| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `BEASTHOST`          | IP/Hostname of a Mode-S/Beast provider (`dump1090`/`readsb`)                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |         |
| `BEASTPORT`          | TCP port number of Mode-S/Beast provider (`dump1090`/`readsb`)                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | `30005` |
| `MLATHOST`           | Legacy parameter. IP/Hostname of an MLAT provider (`mlat-client`). Note - using this parameter will not make the MLAT data part of the consolidated mlathub. The preferred way of ingesting MLAT results is using the `mlathub` functionality of the container, see below for details |         |
| `MLATPORT`           | Legacy parameter used with `MLATHOST`. TCP port number of an MLAT provider (`mlat-client`)                                                                                                                                                                                            | 30105   |

##### Feeding directly from Ultrafeeder

There are several aggregators, both non-profit and commercial, that can directly be sent data from ultrafeeder without the need for an additional feeder container. We have added them in the example `docker-compose.yml` snippet above. Here is a partial list of these aggregators. All of them use the `beast_reduce_plus` format for feeding ADSB data, and `mlat-client` for feeding MLAT:

| Name            | (C)ommercial/<br/>(N)on-profit | Description                                               | Feed details                                                                               | `ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG` snippet |

When feeding AdsbExchange, Ultrafeeder will send statistics to adsbexchange.com by default. See the description of the `ADSBX_STATS` parameter on how to disable this.

To feed AussieADSB (Australia/Oceania only!), execute this command on your host and follow the instructions. You can also use this command to de-register your feeder, or to see its status:

```bash
bash <(wget -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-adsb-ultrafeeder/main/aussieadsb.sh)
```

##### Alternate Configuration Method with `READSB_NET_CONNECTOR`

Instead of (or in addition to) using `ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG`, you can also define ADSB data ingests using the `READSB_NET_CONNECTOR` parameter. Note that this parameter is included for legacy reasons; for consistency, we recommend using `ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG` instead.

This variable allows you to configure incoming and outgoing connections. The variable takes a semicolon (`;`) separated list of `host,port,protocol[,uuid=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX]`, see the section [All-in-One Configuration using `ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG`](#all-in-one-configuration-using-ultrafeeder_config) for explanation of these parameters.

Note: if you have a UAT dongle and use `dump978` to decode this, you should use `READSB_NET_CONNECTOR` to ingest UAT data from `dump978`. See example below

```yaml
    environment:
    ...
      - READSB_NET_CONNECTOR=dump978,30978,uat_in;...
    ...
```

#### Optional Networking Parameters

There are many optional parameters relating to the ingestion of data and the general networking functioning of the `readsb` program that implements this functionality.

#### MLAT configuration

The Ultrafeeder contains a capability to send MLAT data to MLAT servers to be processed, and to receive the MLAT results and integrate those with an MLAT Hub and the `tar1090` map.
It will create a separate instance of `mlat-client` for each defined MLAT server. The parameters for these `mlat-client` instances is as follows:

```yaml
    environment:
    ...
      - ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG=
           ...
           mlat,mlat-server1.com,port1,return_port1,uuid=1234-5678-90123,inputconnect=remote_receiver1:30005,lat=12.3456,lon=45.6789,alt=18m,--arg1 hello --arg2 world;

Note - the optional parameters can be given in any order.

The `MLAT_USER` parameter is passed to the MLAT Client and server, and will show up as a "friendly" name on MLAT related stats at your MLAT aggregator. This parameter can only contain alphanumeric (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) characters, dashes (-), or underscores (_).

#### MLAT troubleshooting

Sometimes, MLAT appears not to be working correctly and you will see messages with high `bad_sync_timeout` values, like this:

```text
[2024-06-29 11:31:20.385][mlat-client][in.adsb.lol] peer_count:  15 outlier_percent: 4.6 bad_sync_timeout: 870
```

Here are a few things you may want to try to fix this:

- Ensure your longitude, latitude, and altitude are ACCURATE
- Make sure your device's clock is synced continuously with a reliable NTP service. We recommend `chronyd` over `systemd.timesyncd`
- Do not try to send MLAT data from a centralized instance when you are using a remote receiver. Instead, feed MLAT directly from the remote station
- On Raspberry Pi 3/3B+, disable HealthCheck by adding the following to the ultrafeeder service section in your `docker-compose.yml` file. (This has to do with docker resource spikes that mess with MLAT timing on slower machines like the Pi3/3B+) :

  ```yaml
    ultrafeeder:
    ...
      healthcheck:
        disable: true
  ```

- MLAT often fails when you run your receiver on a Virtual Machine rather than directly on the hardware. Avoid virtual machines (including ProxMox and container-in-container setups) or disable MLAT on them
- For FlightAware MLAT, make sure that your location and altitude are PRECISELY defined in your dashboard on the FlightAware website
- Never, ever, ever resend MLAT results back to ADSB or MLAT aggregators. Please DO NOT. This will ensure your data is discarded and may get you banned from the aggregator
- If you feed your data to multiple aggregators, please do not enable MLAT for FlightRadar24 (per their request). Note that MLAT for FR24 using our containerized setup is disabled by default

#### Configuring the built-in MLAT Hub

An "MLAT Hub" is an aggregator of MLAT results from several sources. Since the container is capable of sending MLAT data to multiple ADSB aggregators (like adsb.lol/fi/one, etc), we built in a capability to:

- collect the MLAT results from all of these services
- ingest MLAT results from other containers (FlightAware, Radarbox, etc.)
- make the consolidated MLAT results available on a port in Beast or SBS (BaseStation) format
- create outbound connections using any supported format to send your Beast data wherever you want

Note - due to design limitations of `readsb`, the `tar1090` graphical interface will by default ONLY show MLAT results from the aggregators/MLAT sources that were defined with the `MLAT_NET_CONNECTOR` or `ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG=mlat,...` parameters. If you want to show any MLAT results from sources that have their own feeder containers (for example, those from `piaware`), you should add these sources like this:

```yaml
   - ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG=mlathub,host,port,protocol;
```

Where:

- `host` is the hostname where the `MLAT results` are coming from. This can be another container name (e.g., `piaware`) or the IP address of your machine on which `mlat-client` is running. Note -- this is NOT the hostname or IP of the MLAT Server or aggregator that processes the MLAT data
- `port` is the port on which the `mlat-client` on the `host` makes its results available
- `protocol` is the output protocol which is almost always `beast_in`

For example:

```yaml
   - ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG=mlathub,piaware,30105,beast_in;
```

Generally, there is little else to configure, but there are a few parameters that you can set or change:

### Web Gui (`tar1090`) Configuration

The Container creates an interactive web interface displaying the aircraft, based on Wiedehopf's widely used [tar1090](https://github.com/wiedehopf/tar1090) software.

The web interface is rendered to port `80` in the container. This can be mapped to a port on the host using the docker-compose `ports` directive.

All of the variables below are optional.

Note - due to design limitations of `readsb`, the `tar1090` graphical interface will by default ONLY show MLAT results from the aggregators/MLAT sources that were defined with the `MLAT_NET_CONNECTOR` parameter. If you want to show any additional MLAT results (for example, those from `piaware`), you should add a separate `READSB_NET_CONNECTOR` entry for them.

| `TAR1090_AISCATCHER_SERVER` | If you want to show vessels from your AIS-Catcher instance on the map, put the (externally reachable) URL of your AIS-Catcher or ShipFeeder website in this parameter (incl. `https://`). Note - if you are using "barebones" AIS-Catcher you should add `GEOJSON on` after the `-N` parameter on the `AIS-Catcher` command line. If you use [docker-shipfeeder](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-shipfeeder), no change is needed for that container | Empty |
| `TAR1090_AISCATCHER_REFRESH` | Refresh rate (in seconds) of reading vessels from your AIS-Catcher instance. Defaults to 15 (secs) if omitted | `15` |

- TAR1090_ENABLE_AC_DB causes readsb to load the tar1090 database as a csv file from this repository: <https://github.com/wiedehopf/tar1090-db/tree/csv>

#### Using a locally modified tar1090 version

`/local/custom_version` can be any folder you prefer.

Clone tar1090 to a local direcotry: `git clone https://github.com/wiedehopf/tar1090 /local/custom_version`

Make `/local/custom_version` available as `/var/tar1090_git_source` in the container:

```
    volumes:
      - /local/custom_version:/var/tar1090_git_source
```

Make sure you have UPDATE_TAR1090 env var set to true.

Changes in `/local/custom_version` won't be visible with a simple page reload, you need to either restart the container or run:

```
docker exec -it ultrafeeder bash /tar1090-install.sh /run/readsb webroot /usr/local/share/tar1090 /var/tar1090_git_source
```

After this has finished a simple reload in the browser should do the trick.

Another option is to bind / mount a folder to /var/custom_html in the container and set
CUSTOM_HTML=true, be aware no cache busting will be done, nor will any of the tar1090 configuration
settings be applied. The folder will be served as is with aircraft data available as usual at /data.

#### Enabling UAT data

ADS-B over UAT data is transmitted in the 978 MHz band, and this is used in the USA only. To display the corresponding graphs, you should:

1. Set the following environment parameters:

```yaml
      - ENABLE_978=yes
      - URL_978=http://dump978/skyaware978
```

2. Install the [`docker-dump978` container](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-dump978). Note - only containers downloaded/deployed on/after Feb 8, 2023 will work.

Note that you *must* configure `URL_978` to point at a working skyaware978 website with `aircraft.json` data feed. This means that the URL `http://dump978/skyaware978/data/aircraft.json` must return valid JSON data to this `tar1090` container.

#### Enabling AirSpy graphs

Users of AirSpy devices can enable extra `graphs1090` graphs by configuring the following:

1. Set the following environment parameters:

```yaml
      - ENABLE_AIRSPY=yes
      - URL_AIRSPY=http://airspy_adsb
```

2. Install the [`airspy_adsb` container](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/airspy_adsb). Note - only containers downloaded/deployed on/after May 9th, 2024 will work with this method.

#### Enabling Disk IO and IOPS data

To allow the container access to the Disk IO data, you should map the following volume:

```yaml
    volumes:
      - /proc/diskstats:/proc/diskstats:ro
      ...
```

#### Configuring the Core Temperature graphs

By default, the system will use the temperature available at Thermal Zone 0. This generally works well on Raspberry Pi devices, and no additional changes are needed.

On different devices, the Core Temperature is mapped to a different Thermal Zone. To ensure the Core Temperature graph works, follow these steps

First check out which Thermal Zone contains the temperature you want to monitor. On your host system, do this:

```bash
for i in /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone* ; do echo "$i - $(cat ${i}/type) - $(cat ${i}/temp 2>/dev/null)"; done
```

Something similar to this will be show:

```bash
/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0 - acpitz - 25000
/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone1 - INT3400 Thermal - 20000
/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2 - TSKN - 43050
/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone3 - NGFF - 32050
/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone4 - TMEM - 39050
/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone5 - pch_skylake - 40500
/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone6 - B0D4 - 54050
/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone7 - iwlwifi_1 -
/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone8 - x86_pkg_temp - 57000
```

Repeat this a few times to ensure that the temperature varies and isn't hardcoded to a value. In our case, either Thermal Zone 5 (`pch_skylake` is the Intel Core name) or Thermal Zone 8 (the temp of the entire SOC package) can be used. Once you have determined which Thermal Zone number you want to use, map it to a volume like this. Make sure that the part to the left of the first `:` reflects your Thermal Zone directory; the part to the right of the first `:` should always be `/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0:ro`.

Note that you will have to add `- privileged: true` capabilities to the container. This is less than ideal as it will give the container access to all of your system devices and processes. Make sure you feel comfortable with this before you do this.

```yaml
    privileged: true
    volumes:
      - /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone8:/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0:ro
      ...
```

Note - on some systems (DietPi comes to mind), `/sys/class/thermal/` may not be available.

#### Reducing Disk IO for Graphs1090

Note - *this feature is still somewhat experimental. If you are really attached to your statistics/graphs1090 data, please make sure to back up your mapped drives regularly*

If you are using a Raspberry Pi or another type of computer with an SD card, you may already be aware that these SD cards have a limited number of write-cycles that will determine their lifespan. In other words - a common reason for SD card failure is excessive writes to it.

By the nature of having to log lots of data the `graphs1090` functionality writes a lot to the SD card. To reduce the number of write cycles, there are a few parameters you can set.

Enabling this functionality will cause `graphs1090` to temporarily write all data to volatile memory (`/run`) instead of persistent disk space (`/var/lib/collectd`). This data is backed up to persistent disk space in regular intervals and upon (graceful) shutdown of the container.

Note -- there is a chance that the data isn't written back in time (due to power failures, non-graceful container shutdowns, etc), in which case you may lose statistics data that has been generated since the last write-back.

The feature assumes that you have mapped `/var/lib/collectd` to a volume (to ensure data is persistent across container recreations), and `/run` as a `tmpfs` RAM disk, as shown below and also as per the [`docker-compose.yml` example](docker-compose.yml):

```yaml
    volumes:
      - /opt/adsb/ultrafeeder/globe_history:/var/globe_history
...
    tmpfs:
      - /run:exec,size=256M
...
```

| Environment Variable              | Purpose                                                                                        | Default |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `GRAPHS1090_REDUCE_IO=`           | Optional Set to `true` to reduce the write cycles for `graphs1090`                             | Unset   |
| `GRAPHS1090_REDUCE_IO_FLUSH_IVAL` | Interval (i.e. 1h, 6h, 24h, 1d, 2d) writing `graphs1090` data back to non-volatile storage     | `1d`    |

### `timelapse1090` Configuration

Legacy: **We recommend AGAINST enabling this feature** as it has been replaced with <http://dockerhost:port/?replay>. `timelapse1090` writes a lot of data to disk, which could shorten the lifespan of your Raspiberry Pi SD card. The replacement functionality is better and doesn't cause any additional disk writes.

| Environment Variable     | Purpose                                                                                                                         | Default |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `ENABLE_TIMELAPSE1090`   | Optional / Legacy. Set to `true` to enable timelapse1090. Once enabled, can be accessed via <http://dockerhost:port/timelapse/> | Unset   |
| `TIMELAPSE1090_INTERVAL` | Snapshot interval in seconds                                                                                                    | `10`    |
| `TIMELAPSE1090_HISTORY`  | Time saved in hours                                                                                                             | `24`    |

## Updating your location with GPSD

This feature enables you to deploy Ultrafeeder while you are moving around. It will read your current longitude/latitude/altitude from a GPS unit that is connected to `gpsd` on your host system, and ensure that the map will show your current location. It will also restart any `mlat-client` instances once it detects that you moved from your previous location.

### Basic Installation and Configuration of your GPS hardware and `gpsd` drivers

The simplest way of getting this to work is to acquire a ["VK163" USB GPS "Mouse"](https://a.co/d/0D7Tj0n), similar to the one in the link. You can connect this mouse to any USB port on your machine.

For this to work, you should install and configure GPSD to work on your host machine. The `DEVICES` parameter is probably correct as shown below, but you may want to double-check that data is received on that device (`cat /dev/ttyACM0`) and adjust it if needed:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y gpsd
cat << EOM | sudo tee /etc/default/gpsd
# Devices gpsd should collect to at boot time.
# They need to be read/writeable, either by user gpsd or the group dialout.
DEVICES="/dev/ttyACM0"
# Other options you want to pass to gpsd
GPSD_OPTIONS="-G"
# Automatically hot add/remove USB GPS devices via gpsdctl
USBAUTO="true"
EOM
cat << EOM | sudo tee /lib/systemd/system/gpsd.socket
[Unit]
Description=GPS (Global Positioning System) Daemon Sockets

[Socket]
ListenStream=/run/gpsd.sock
ListenStream=[::]:2947
ListenStream=0.0.0.0:2947
SocketMode=0600
BindIPv6Only=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=sockets.target
EOM
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart gpsd gpsd.socket
```

Then, you can add the following values to `ultrafeeder` service settings in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
...
  ultrafeeder:
    ...
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
    ...
    environment:
      ULTRAFEEDER-CONFIG=
        gpsd,host.docker.internal,2947;
    ...
```

Finally, restart the container with `docker compose up -d`

This will:

- install and configure `gpsd` (`/etc/default/gpsd`) so it makes GPS data available on the default TCP port 2947 of your host system
- configure the ultrafeeder docker container to read GPSD data
- configure the ultrafeeder container so the hostname `host.docker.internal` always resolves to the IP address of the underlying machine (where `gpsd` is running)

If you have any issues, readsb will use verbose output if you add the `GPSD_DEBUG=true` as an environment variable.

### Optional parameters regulating the restart of `mlat-client` when the location changes

The following parameters are all optional and are subject to change.  These variables should be added to the environment section of your docker-compose.yml. They will not work if entered into the .env file. You don't need to set them unless you want to change the default behavior.

| Environment Variable | Purpose | Default |
| -------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| `GPSD_MIN_DISTANCE` | Distance (in meters) that your station must move before it's considered moving (maximum 40 meters) | `20` (meters) |
| `GPSD_MLAT_WAIT` | The wait period (in seconds) your station must be stationary before mlat is started (minimum 90 seconds) | `90` (seconds) |
| `GPSD_CHECK_INTERVAL` | How often the container checks for updated location information. (minimum 5 seconds) | `30` (seconds) |

See example below:

```yaml
    environment:
    ...
      - GPSD_MIN_DISTANCE=20
      - GPSD_MLAT_WAIT=90
      - GPSD_CHECK_INTERVAL=30
    ...
```

## Web Pages

If you have configured the container as described above, you should be able to browse to the following web pages:
You should now be able to browse to:

- <http://dockerhost/> to access the tar1090 web interface.
- <http://dockerhost/?replay> to see a replay of past data
- <http://dockerhost/?heatmap> to see the heatmap for the past 24 hours
- <http://dockerhost/?heatmap&realHeat> to see a different heatmap for the past 24 hours
- <http://dockerhost/?pTracks> to see the tracks of all planes for the past 24 hours
- <http://dockerhost/graphs1090/> to see performance graphs

## Paths

No paths need to be mapped through to persistent storage. However, if you don't want to lose your range outline and aircraft tracks/history and heatmap / replay data on container restart, you can optionally map these paths:

| Path                                                                                                          | Purpose                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/opt/adsb/ultrafeeder/globe_history:/var/globe_history`                                                      | Holds range outline data, heatmap / replay data and traces if enabled. *Note: this data won't be automatically deleted, you will need to delete it eventually if you map this path.* |
| `/opt/adsb/ultrafeeder/timelapse1090:/var/timelapse1090`                                                      | Holds timelapse1090 data if enabled. (We recommend against enabling this feature, see above)                                     |
| `/opt/adsb/ultrafeeder/collectd:/var/lib/collectd`                                                            | Holds graphs1090 & performance data                                                                                              |
| `/proc/diskstats:/proc/diskstats:ro`                                                                          | Makes disk statistics available to `graphs1090`                                                                                  |
| `/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone8:/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0:ro`                                        | Only needed on some systems to display the CPU temperature in `graphs1090`, see [here](#configuring-the-core-temperature-graphs) |

## Display of Metrics with Grafana and Prometheus/InfluxDB

When using the `:telegraf` tag, the image contains [Telegraf](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/), which can be used to capture metrics from `ultrafeeder` if an output is enabled.

See [README-grafana.md](README-grafana.md) for detailed instruction on how to configure this.

**NOTE - READ CAREFULLY**: As of 27 April 2023, the `latest` image no longer contains Telegraf. If you want to send metrics to InfluxDB or Prometheus, please use this image:

```yaml
services:
  ultrafeeder:
    image: ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-adsb-ultrafeeder:telegraf
  ...
```

### Configuring Grafana

Please see the [separate instruction document](README-grafana.md) for step by step instructions on how to set up and configure a Grafana Dashboard with Prometheus. The sections below are provided as a reference.

### Output from Ultrafeeder to Prometheus

In order for Telegraf to serve a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) endpoint, the following environment variables can be used:

| Variable            | Description                                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `PROMETHEUS_ENABLE` | Set to `true` for a Prometheus endpoint on `http://0.0.0.0:9273/metrics` |

### Output from Ultrafeeder to InfluxDBv2

In order for Telegraf to output metrics to an [InfluxDBv2](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/) time-series database, the following environment variables can be used:

| Variable            | Description                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `INFLUXDBV2_URL`    | The URL of the InfluxDB instance    |
| `INFLUXDBV2_TOKEN`  | The token for authentication        |
| `INFLUXDBV2_BUCKET` | Destination bucket to write into    |
| `INFLUXDBV2_ORG`    | InfluxDB Organization to write into |

## Message decoding introspection

You can look at individual messages and what information they contain, either for all or for an individual aircraft by hex:

```bash
# only for hex 3D3ED0
docker exec -it ultrafeeder /usr/local/bin/viewadsb --show-only 3D3ED0

# for all aircraft
docker exec -it ultrafeeder /usr/local/bin/viewadsb --no-interactive

# show position / CPR debugging for hex 3D3ED0
docker exec -it ultrafeeder /usr/local/bin/viewadsb --cpr-focus 3D3ED0
```

## Minimalist setup

If you want to use `ultrafeeder` *only* as a SDR decoder but without any mapping or stats/graph websites, without MLAT connections or MLAT-hub, etc., for example to minimize CPU and RAM needs on a low CPU/memory single board computer, then do the following:

- in the `ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG` parameter, remove any entry that starts with `mlat` or `mlathub`. This will prevent any `mlat-client`s or `mlathub` instances to be launched. If you still want to connect the `mlat-client`(s) to external MLAT servers but you don't want to run the overhead of a MLATHUB, you can leave any entries starting with `mlat` in the `ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG` parameter, and set `MLATHUB_DISABLE=true`
- Set the parameter `TAR1090_DISABLE=true`. This will prevent the `nginx` webserver and any websites to be launched and no `collectd` (graphs1090) or `rrd` (ADSB message history) data to be collected or retained.
- Make sure to use `ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-adsb-ultrafeeder:latest` and specifically NOT the `ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-adsb-ultrafeeder:telegraf` label as Telegraf adds a LOT of resource use to the container

## Offline maps

There is the option to use some basic offline maps limited in zoom:

- Download  the tiles (don't install tar1090): <https://github.com/wiedehopf/adsb-wiki/wiki/offline-map-tiles-tar1090>
- Add a volume mapping so the container can access the tiles:

```yaml
    volumes:
        - /usr/local/share/osm_tiles_offline:/usr/local/share/osm_tiles_offline
```

## Logging

All logs are to the container's stdout and can be viewed with `docker logs -t [-f] container`.
